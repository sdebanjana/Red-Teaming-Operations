For git research, used- wget, cat, cd and .git
For blind guessing, I have used 10.1.0.12 's wesite. I have just used admin as username and admin as password and I got the access.

Command used: wget --mirror -I .git http://10.1.0.7/.git
git status | head -n 15
cd 10.1.0.7
cd .git
git init
cat 'index.html'
cat 'index.html?C=D;O=A'
cat 'index.html?C=D;O=D'
cat 'index.html?C=M;O=A'
cat 'index.html?C=M;O=D'
cat 'index.html?C=N;O=A'
cat 'index.html?C=N;O=D'
cat 'index.html?C=S;O=A'
cat 'index.html?C=S;O=D'

From the sensetive data file and old backup and unreferenced file, it was easy to crack the password using wordlists.

Additionally I found a source of clues about unreferenced directories, using 10.1.0.11/robots.txt command. Shown in output images.
